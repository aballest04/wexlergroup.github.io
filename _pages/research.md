# Wexler Group Research

As the damages associated with climate change intensify in the coming years, it
will become increasingly more important for educators and researchers to focus 
on sustainable energy and environmental remediation. Computational materials 
chemistry has the potential to revolutionize the industries responsible for 
these damages by alleviating their reliance on fossil fuels, precious metals, 
and toxic elements. Inspired by this potential, my career plans center around 
solving grand challenges in energy and environment by designing and developing 
next-generation technologies for water splitting, CO<sub>2</sub> utilization, 
solar energy conversion, and environmental energy harvesting. More specifically, 
I aim, through theoretical innovations and experimental collaborations, to 
answer questions like
{: .text-justify}

* "Can we design electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction that are 
active/stable in basic solutions?"
* "How can we overcome selectivity-conversion limits for the electrochemical 
CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction?"
* "What are the factors limiting solar-cell efficiency and how can we control 
them?"
* "Which properties govern the performance of ferroelectric energy harvesters 
for the Internet of Things?"

Answering these questions in catalysis, solar power, and transduction will 
require improvements in the way that materials interfaces are currently modeled,
which can be achieved via next-generation computational methods for ab initio 
thermodynamics that combine my expertise in first-principles quantum mechanics 
calculations, Monte Carlo simulations, data science, and machine learning. More 
broadly, my career plans can be subdivided into four distinct visions that 
address these challenges from different angles:
{: .text-justify}

1. To develop state-of-the-art computational techniques for the realistic modeling of materials 
   interfaces
2. To provide fundamental understanding and design principles for sustainable H<sub>2</sub> 
   production and controllable CO<sub>2</sub> conversion
3. To improve solar-cell efficiency via chemical modification and interfacial engineering
4. To create efficient machine learning tools for the accurate simulation and rational design of 
   ferroelectric energy harvesters
